In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and surgical planning in medical applications, this study proposes a three-dimensional coronary vessel tree simulation method based on an advanced computational model. We introduced in detail the entire technical process from obtaining original medical imaging data to completing the simulation of fine blood vessel structures. The study first used B-spline curve technology to accurately construct the centerline model of blood vessels based on detailed medical imaging data. Subsequently, point cloud technology was applied to generate a three-dimensional surface of the blood vessel, which","metadata":{"filetype":"application/pdf","languages":["eng"],"page_number":1,"filename":"layout-parser-paper.pdf"}},{"type":"NarrativeText","element_id":"3a0a60235abde23e5b0ed775f9508e38","text":"can provide a detailed view and data support of the blood vessel structure.","metadata":{"filetype":"application/pdf","languages":["eng"],"page_number":1,"filename":"layout-parser-paper.pdf"}}]
